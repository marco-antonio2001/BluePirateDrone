This project is one of two parts to my final year project in college as an electronic engineer, the goal of my project was to design design and develop a drone flight control system with a Ground Control Station (GCS) for real-time monitoring and control. The system consists of two main components, the flight controller onboard the drone and the GCS on the ground. The flight controller utilizes an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to sense the drone's orientation and employs a control algorithm to maintain a user-defined orientation by adjusting the speed of the motors. The GCS provides a graphical user interface for the user to monitor the drone's orientation in real-time, modify desired orientation, adjust control parameters, record flight data, and analyse flight performance.

This repo implements Ground Control Station in the .NET 8 SDK with the  WPF GUI.To build this code some variables will need to be changed, first of all the apth to the python engine dll need to be updated to match your system, same for your model path and your flight data path. there probably is away to standerdize this and i will fix it in the future. I acknowledge that this is not a perfect project i will continue to work on this but i hope it can help someone. Please any critizism is welcome
